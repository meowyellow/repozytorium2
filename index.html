		<h2>Levitating<h2>
		<h3>
		[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time</h3>
<h3>
[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
</h3>
<h3>

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating bongo la, bongo czacza cza
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating</h3>

<h3>
[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are

</h3>
